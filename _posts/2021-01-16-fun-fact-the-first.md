A prefix is a letter or group of letters, that can be added to __the beginning__ of a word to make a new word. *This is not a fun fact.*<br />
A suffix is a letter of group of letters, that can be added to __the end__ of a word to make a new word. *This is not a fun fact, yes.*<br />
For example, 're-' stands for 'to do again', and '-able' means 'it's possible to do something'. There are lots of others in vocabulary tree, so you can find them easily in your dictionary.<br /><br />

__Here is a fun fact:__ The longest word in English language consists of several prefixes and suffixes, both surprisingly and unsurprisingly.<br />
It is called: __antidisestablishmentarianism__

Don't worry, I know. It *is* complicated. Let's cut down this word, and you would find out that nothing is easier than ever.<br />
First, there *is* a prefix, sorry, but, no, there *are* prefixes: 'anti-' and 'dis-'.<br />
Second, similarilly, suffixes also exists: '-ment', '-arian', and '-ism'.<br /><br />

They have meanings, of course.<br />
  + __'anti-'__: opposed to, or against
  + __'dis-'__: used to form the opposite or negative
  + __'-ment'__: used to form a noun referring to an action, a process or its result
  + __'-arian'__: a person who has a connection with, or belief in, the stated subject
  + __'-ism'__: 'used to form nouns which describe social, political or religious beliefs
<br />

Now we are able to guess what the heck this word means. <br />
A belief + a person + an opposite + a negative thoughts on phenomenon, etc. + establishment = ? <br />
Here is a definition from Cambridge Learner's Dictionary: <br/>
*opposition to the belief that there should not be an official relationship between a country's government and its national Chruch* <br /><br />

Quite tough, huh?
