# Welcome!
This is a personal blog.

I'm Suyeon Park who lives in Seoul. Currently learning service design engineering and art & technology in Sungshin University(성신여자대학교). 

In fact, illustration, writing science fiction and column, playing the electric guitar in rock band are also my interests.

Hope there are no more stereotypes against a person who enjoys a lot of different fields at the same time.
